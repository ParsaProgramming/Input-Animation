# Input-Animation

in this project I could use valid selector in Sass but I didn't. I create it my own with javascript :) I mean the classes **valid** and **invalid**. I created two variables to seprate the colors that are userful like red and green to end this mini project. and at the end I hope that you enjoy this mini project.

**I tried to create this options in this mini project**:
- if username was less than 8 characters, it would give error.
- create the graphic of acceptable and not acceptable username.
- create the animation of label
